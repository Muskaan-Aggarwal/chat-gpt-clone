# ChatGPT Clone
## Overview
**This project is a clone of the popular ChatGPT AI chatbot, built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The application allows users to interact with a conversational AI model, asking questions and receiving responses in a chat-like interface.**

## Technologies Used
### Front-end:
1. HTML: Structure and content
2. CSS: Styling and layout
3. Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
4. JavaScript: Dynamic behavior and interactions
### Back-end:
1. Python: Server-side language for API and model integration
2. Flask: Micro web framework for building the API
   
## Features
1. Conversational AI chatbot interface
2. User input and response display
3. Support for multiple conversation topics and intents
4. Integration with a trained language model for accurate responses
5. Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
## Getting Started
### Front-end
